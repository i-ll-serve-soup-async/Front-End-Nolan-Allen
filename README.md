MVP Features Breakdown:

1. Login page: simple form for a user login flow. Users can enter username and password and login or sign up as a soup kitchen manager. 
2. Home Page: a grid list of inventory items, (uncategorized for MVP, stretch will be to add categories) that a soup kitchen manager can use to track units, weights, quantities etc. 
3. Add inventory item page: User can add a new item in their inventory to create an item. i.e. potatoes: '20lbs'
4. Edit inventory item: user can edit the quantity, amount, weight or value of an item in their kitchen. 

If an inventory item reaches a '0' (or low threshold) quantity, make sure to indicate to the manager that they need to restock the item by showing that item as out of stock etc.
